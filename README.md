This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: accessing component state or props before the component has mounted.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the correct implementation.  This often leads to unexpected behavior and `undefined` values.  The solution involves using `useEffect` hook to ensure state and props are accessed after mounting.
